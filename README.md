📝 Game Rules
The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.

Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10.

Number cards are worth their face value.

Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is more favorable.

Both player and dealer start with 2 cards.

The player goes first, choosing to:

Hit: Draw another card.

Stand: End turn and keep current hand.

If the player’s hand exceeds 21, it's a bust (automatic loss).

After the player stands:

The dealer reveals their hidden card.

The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher.

The winner is determined based on the closest hand to 21:

Higher total wins (without busting).

Tie goes to the dealer (optional rule, can be changed).

Blackjack (Ace + 10) is an instant win.
